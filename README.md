# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

In this Mobile Budge project we added
- a History page with weekly data on flatlist.
- Profile page with expense summary, user's social login info and an image or photograph.
- static images provided by online graphics resource platform
- Standard back button implemented with BackHandler to confirm exit from the app

These were some differences, in relation to the original project found on Youtube previously developed by TubeGuruji with the title """React Native Full Stack App | React Native Budget Planner App | | Expo, Supabase, Kinde"""


&nbsp;
# Feature <a name = "Feature"></a>
- POST GET PUT & DELETE in PostgreSQl using Supabase
- The data is storaged in DBaaS (DataBase as a Service)
- Shows in flatList items added in the current week
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) using user email



&nbsp;
# Technologies <a name = "Technologies"></a>
- JavaScript Full Stack
- React Native, Cross-platform mobile development
- Supabase, Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that hosts PostgreSQL database
- Social Authentication using Kinde (robust and scalable authentication)
- Expo 52, framework to development mobile cross-platform, and server simulator
- ImagePicker lib to select avatar image
